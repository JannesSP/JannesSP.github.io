## Preprint: Magnipore: Prediction of differential single nucleotide changes in the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing signal of SARS-CoV-2 samples

### Abstract:
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) allows direct sequencing of ribonucleic acids (RNA) and, in addition, detection of possible RNA modifications due to deviations from the expected ONT signal. The software available so far for this purpose can only detect a small number of modifications. Alternatively, two samples can be compared for different RNA modifications. We present Magnipore, a novel tool to search for significant signal shifts between samples of Oxford Nanopore data from similar or related species. Magnipore classifies them into mutations and potential modifications. We use Magnipore to compare SARS-CoV-2 samples. Included were representatives of the early 2020s Pango lineages (n=6), samples from Pango lineages B.1.1.7 (n=2, Alpha), B.1.617.2 (n=1, Delta), and B.1.529 (n=7, Omicron). Magnipore utilizes position-wise Gaussian distribution models and a comprehensible significance threshold to find differential signals. In the case of Alpha and Delta, Magnipore identifies 55 detected mutations and 15 sites that hint at differential modifications. We predicted potential virus-variant and variant-group-specific differential modifications. Magnipore contributes to advancing RNA modification analysis in the context of viruses and virus variants.
